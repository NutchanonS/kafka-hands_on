# kafka-hands_on
This is my hands-on kafka project that I learn from a youtube tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KerNf0NANMo&list=PLXkp09OnKgF1TpTpA_KfE5ks2fb20275N&index=13) on Darshil Parmar channel. The project is about sending the stock data via the Kafka server that launches on AWS EC2 machine. The data is sent from producer to consumer to store in an AWS S3 bucket.
